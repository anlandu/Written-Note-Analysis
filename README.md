# Written Note Analysis

## Objective
The aim of this project is to recognize and convert images of written notes ( .img, .pdf, .png) into text and then analyze the content to determine the subject matter. We hope to accomplish this through a combination of image processing and text analysis in python. By using existing libraries we hope to be able to read the image using opencv, recognize text using tesseract, and extract main topics using nltk.
