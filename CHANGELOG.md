# CHANGELOG
This file contains daily changes/commits and general work done on the project.

##1/29
Created CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, LICENSE, README.md.
Pivoted from mapping to using computer vision. Current idea is to use computer vision to identify and match rashes to the plants that cause them. Although there is some current proprietary software using this, no open source equivalent  exists.

## 1/30
Created CHANGELOG.md.

## 1/31
Pivoted to a more generic application of computer vision, as the Rash idea would not be as useful to the greater community.

## 2/5-6
Major difficulties with downloading OpenCV. Attempts to run through tutorials have been unsuccessful. Although I know I want to use computer vision, I am unsure what exact direction to go in my project.

## 2/8
Updated CHANGELOG.MD and README.md.

## 2/9
Decided on Written-Note-Analysis, a project that will combine computer vison, character recognition, and text analysis to read notes and analyze the subject.

##2/11
Updated README.md in preparation for non-sibi project week.  

## 2/12-16
Non Sibi Week
Side Note: 2/ 13: Talked to Dr.Z about project. Official plan is to use OpenCV to computer vision,use tesseract to recognize characters, and nltk to analyze the text
-------------

## 2/19-20
Downloaded and tested tesseract with added files.
